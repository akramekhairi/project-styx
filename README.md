### About application:

- The app is named after the river Styx from Greek Mythology, which brought knowledge
and wisdom to the people.The app will showcase flowcharts in 3D space using AR
technology. The user can follow the flow, or the river, of pregenerated charts.

- The appâ€™s goal is to make the processes behind technological advancements,
historic developments etc easier to understand, by letting the user experience them
head on, by mapping them out in an AR environment.These include flowcharts from
various topics such as evolution, technological, scientific and historical developments, etc.

- Every divergence of the flow will contain an explanation for it, with 3D models, pictures
or texts, and so will every significant point in the process. The app would require the
user to be in open space, such as a park or a backyard and the app will scale the virtual
flowchart to the space provided.

- The app is targeting mainly educational professions as well as students, as the template
can be used for educating in any topic of choice.
